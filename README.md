Tutoprompt
==========

Teach command line tools step by step. It will change the user's prompt to display instructions to learn
a particular tool. I have been using this to teach a Faup Workshop during Hack.lu and I believe this can
be useful to many people beside me.

How to use?
-----------

Create a step by step tutorial with validation. Check out the examples/ folder. Then install it by typing
./tutoprompt.sh --install examples/faupworkshop if you plan to reuse my tutorial.

If you want to remove it, simply run ./tutoprompt.sh --remove

Enjoy!
